## Highlights üéâ

v0.6.9 delivers two highly requested features: **image support for multimodal models** and **stable MCP** (no more experimental flags!). Plus intelligent model capability detection, enhanced tool calling, and major UX improvements.

### üñºÔ∏è Multimodal AI is here

**Image upload support** ‚Äî Finally! Upload images directly in your chats and get visual understanding from compatible models:
- **Local models**: Automatic support for Gemma3, Qwen3, and other vision-capable models
- **Cloud models**: Manual toggle for GPT-4V, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro Vision
- **Smart detection**: Jan automatically identifies which models support images
- **Privacy first**: Local models process images entirely offline

The team has been working hard to bring this long-awaited capability to Jan, and it's been worth the wait.

### üîß MCP is stable

**Model Context Protocol** graduated from experimental to stable:
- **No more experimental flags** ‚Äî MCP tools work out of the box
- **Better error handling** for smoother MCP server connections
- **Cancel tool calls** mid-execution when needed
- **Enhanced reliability** with improved server status tracking

MCP unlocks powerful workflows: web search, code execution, productivity integrations, and more.

### üéØ Intelligent model management

- **Auto-detect capabilities**: Jan identifies tool calling and vision support for local models
- **Model compatibility checker**: Hub shows hardware requirements before download
- **Favorite models**: Mark frequently used models for quick access
- **Universal GGUF import**: Import any valid .gguf file regardless of extension
- **Hardware-aware suggestions**: Get model recommendations based on your system specs

### üöÄ Enhanced tool calling

- **GPT-OSS models**: Upgraded llama.cpp brings tool calling to more open-source models
- **Improved performance**: Better tool execution with upgraded engine
- **Remote provider control**: Manual toggle for cloud model capabilities
- **Streamlined workflows**: Cancel operations, better error handling

## Major Features

- **Ollama endpoint** support restored for custom configurations

### üé® User experience
- **Thinking windows** for OpenRouter models render correctly
- **Better error messages** across MCP operations
- **Improved import UX** with retired model cleanup
- **CPU architecture** detection at runtime

### üîß Technical enhancements
- **Vulkan backend** re-enabled for integrated GPUs with sufficient memory
- **Enhanced stability** with better error handling
- **Performance optimizations** across the board

## Thanks to our incredible team

The engineering team delivered major features that users have been requesting for months. Image support required deep multimodal AI integration, while stabilizing MCP involved extensive testing and refinement. The auto-detection features showcase thoughtful UX design that makes AI more accessible.

Special recognition to the contributors who made v0.6.9 possible through their dedication to bringing powerful, privacy-focused AI capabilities to everyone.
